## RISK MANAGEMENT

### Identified Risks & Mitigation

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| Kubernetes complexity | Medium | Use Helm abstractions, reference docs, community support |
| Auth integration bugs | Medium | Extensive testing with LDAP/SAML providers, test servers |
| Performance regressions | Low | Comprehensive benchmarking, performance testing |
| Schedule overrun | Medium | Weekly progress tracking, buffer time built in |
| Redis session loss | Very Low | Configure persistence, backup procedures |
| Encryption key loss | Very Low | Vault integration, backup key procedures |
